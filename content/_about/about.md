# About us

## Who we are and what we're about
Write The Docs Bay Area is a local chapter of the Write The Docs organization. Our group plans meetups about whatever is new, smart, or making waves in documentation. We meet in San Francisco, the East Bay, and the South Bay, because our members are all over the Bay Area.

Write The Docs is comprised of people who care about making the user experience better by creating excellent documentation. We are writers, developers, designers, learning professionals, and documentation enthusiasts.

Come to our meetup to talk about what makes documentation great, and to meet others in the Bay Area who care about documentation.

## About  Write The Docs

Write The Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation.

We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.

Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of documentarians to share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art and science of documentation.
